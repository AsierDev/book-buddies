# Book Buddies


## Definition:


    Book Buddies is a book recommendation site. Users must create an account in order to access its content.

    Users can search for books by their titles, authors, ISBN, category or any keyword.

    This site is aimed at Spanish speakers and should return the book results in Spanish.

    Once the user has an account, they can rate any book, write a review, add the book to favorites or add them to the wishlist.
